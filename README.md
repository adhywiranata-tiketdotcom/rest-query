# tix-rest-query
Hooks for Fetching, Caching, and Updating RESTful Service Data in React. Heavily Inspired by [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) with tiket.com Flight Team use-cases.

## Motivation

Fetching data from REST API and storing it to state is arguably simple, but it is so easy to clutter the codebase when the size of the app grows. This hooks helps that issue by removing reliance on Redux or any other global state management mechanism for storing server data and to cache them efficiently based on current knows use cases.

## Features

- [ ] Ability to fetch data from remote server once, then cache it for certain amount of time, declaratively.
- [ ] Normalize API responses right after fetching the data to avoid data normalization on UI components.
